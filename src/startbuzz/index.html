                <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn
                good cup
                of coffee. Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his
                plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
                In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you can enjoy Starbuzz just about
                anywhere. And,
                of course, the big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Web developers to create
                Starbuzz's
                Web presence, which is growing rapidly and helping to meet
                the caffeine needs of a whole new set of customers.
